1) MAPPING GROUND TESTS
        
        Files:  sonar_airframe_MAPPING_TEST.xml airframe
                01sonar_groundtest.xml          flight plan

        
        Please save the logs in a structured way, to make it
        easier to understand them later!



        Tests:  Logging Sonar Measurements
                        In the flight plan start the logging and
                        stop with the corresponding blocks.

                        ftp 192.168.42.1
                        cd internal_000
                        ls
                        get

                        then you should see the following files:
                                map.csv
                                map_nozero.csv 
                                map_filtered_sonar.csv
                                000_final_map.csv
                                map_visualization.csv

                        I'm also trying to print map_viusalization
                        to the Paparazzi Center window terminal.
                                

                Test Mapped Area
                        ORIENTATION TEST: we must check if the map
                        is oriented correctly. It is possible that
                        the map is rotated 90 degrees.
                        Start the logging, and carry the drone along
                        a line with a known orientation (walk south-
                        north, or walk along one side of the cyber-
                        zoo). Then open the map_visualization.csv
                        and see if the orientation is correct.

                        TEST BORDERS: walk along the borders of the
                        cyberzoo, and check the borders of the map-
                        ped area. Remember that the map is has the
                        SP corners, and the OZ is rotated within it
                        with 33 degrees. Also the OZ is
                        significantly smaller than the cyberzoo.
                        (Just remember how the SP and OZ cubes
                        looked together, and also remember how ob-
                        stacle zone looks in the flightplan.)

2) DAVID'S MAPPING

        Files:  sonar_airframe_MAPPING_TEST.xml airframe
                02nosonar_mapping.xml           flight plan

                Test the survey run

                        Is it stable?
                        Or we are ending up in the net again.



                        Set mapping speed
                        Measure the mapping run with a stopwatch.
                        If there are overshoots on the turning po-
                        ints then reduce speed.
                        The speed can be set in the flightplan,
                        
                        line 107<call fun="!gh_set_max_speed(1)"/> 
                        

        
                        Altitude hold?
                        Check if there are huge deviations in the
                        altitude. Now the height for mapping is set
                        for 3 meters. It can be changed by overwrit-
                        ing the waypoints. To high altitude might
                        cause the instabilities (however I think
                        3-4 meter should be ok...), with to low alti-
                        tude we might crash into the obstacles, es-
                        pecially if the alt hold is not working cor-
                        rectly.

3) MAPPING RUN + SONAR MAPPING

        Files:  sonar_airframe_MAPPING_TEST.xml airframe
                03sonar_mapping2.xml            flight plan

                DO NOT CONFUSE FLIGHT PLAN WITH sonar_mapping.xml!!!

        The two previous tests combined. Survey run with active 
        sonar logging and data postprocessing. Mapping alt and 
        speed can be adjusted as in TEST 2.
